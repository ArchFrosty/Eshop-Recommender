E-shop product recommender using *cosine similarity* and trends for users without many previous purchases. I will not be
publishing the dataset for which this project was created.


## DISCLAIMER - please read!

This is a *personal* project and it is not inteded for easy use by other users. This repository may contain: hard-coded paths,
have no error handling, snippets lifted from stackoverflow or some other place, *__inappropriate__ error messages, comments and variable names*, generally disgusting code that
violates many good coding practices and there
is a slight chance it *might not even work correctly* - I am not guaranteeing anything. 

**The only reason this repository is public is for easy sharing with friends and hope that this code or snippet of it
might help somebody out there.**

With that said, feel free to ask questions and I will try to help you, or at least point you in the right direction.
